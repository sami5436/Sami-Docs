# Sami's Docs

Hi! I'm Sami Hamdalla, a computer science student at the University of Houston. I love learning about cloud technologies, software design, and solving challenging problems. This repo is where I document what I'm learning and keep my notes organized.

### Terraform

During my time at ExxonMobil, I had the privilege of working with a powerful and emerging tool called **Terraform**. Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables cloud engineers to build, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure using a simple, declarative language. It allows for scalable, version-controlled infrastructure deployments across cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Core Components of Terraform:
- Providers:
  - Plugins that interact with APIs of cloud platforms and services (AWS, Azure, GitHub). They define what infrastructure Terraform can manage.
- Resources:
  - The basic building blocks in Terraform. Each resource corresponds to an infrastructure object (like an EC2 instance, a storage account, etc).
- Modules:
  - Self-contained packages of Terraform configurations. They help reuse code and organize complex infrastructure
- Variables:
  - Inputs that allow configurations to be dynamic and reusable. Can be defined using variable blocks and passed via CLI, environment, or .tfvars files.
- Outputs:
  - Values you want to extract from your Terraform configuration, useful for debugging or passing data between modules.
- State:
  - Terraform uses a state file (terraform.tfstate) to map real-world infrastructure to your config. This file is critical for tracking changes and performing updates efficiently
  - Sometimes this is stored in storage on cloud if Terraform open source is used. This is done to ensure everyone is using the same version of the state file.
- Backend:
  - Defines how and where Terraform stores its state. Common backends include local, S3 with DynamoDB locking, Azure Storage Account, or remote via Terraform Cloud. (Mentioned in state section).
- Lifecycle Rules:
  - Allow for finer control of resource behavior, such as create_before_destroy, ignore_changes, etc.
- Data Sources:
  - Used to fetch information from providers (e.g., get the latest AMI ID from AWS) without creating new resources.
